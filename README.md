# 23imgs-v2
Version 2 saves images to mongoDB rather than a digital ocean space


This project is live on https://dsousadev.github.io/23imgs/

23imgs is a simple web application built with React. Anyone can post an image, only the 23 most recent are posted. You cannot delete an image once you post it, it will be removed when it is the "24th" image.
